REST PKI Python Sample
======================

This folder contains a web application written in Python using the Flask framework, that shows how to use the
[REST PKI service](https://pki.rest/). The sample application should work on Python versions 2.7 and 3.5.

For other languages, please visit the [repository root](https://github.com/LacunaSoftware/RestPkiSamples).

To run the samples, you will need an **API access token**. If you don't have one, register on the
[REST PKI website](https://pki.rest/) and generate a token.

Running the sample
------------------

To run the sample:

1. [Download the project](https://github.com/LacunaSoftware/RestPkiSamples/archive/master.zip)
   or clone the repository

1. Generate an API access token on the [REST PKI website](https://pki.rest/)

1. Paste your access token on the file `sample/utils.py`
   
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

1. Set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to define the name of app that
 should be run: `FLASK_APP=sample`

5. Run the web application: `flask run`

6. Access the URL [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

Optionally, you can create and activate a "virtualenv" to avoid mixing library versions:

    virtualenv <venv>
    source bin/activate (on Windows: ./<venv>/Scripts/activate)
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python manage.py runserver
    deactivate
